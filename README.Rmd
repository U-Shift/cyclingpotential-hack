# Cycling Potential hackathon

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

A hackathon on international methods for estimating cycling potential, based on a case study in Lisbon.  
Further details will come soon.

## Input datasets
Initial datasets, `.geojson`  

1. Desire lines between cities  
2. Cycling routes from [cyclestreets.net](cyclestreets.net)
    - Fastest  
    - Balanced  
    - Quietest  
 
[Releases](https://github.com/U-Shift/cyclingpotential-hack/releases/)

# Topics
Here are a couple of ideas...

* Cycling uptake functions  
* Estimating flow between Origins and Destinations using spatial interaction models  
* Routing algorithms and routing services - hilliness integration?  
* Use of counting points data
